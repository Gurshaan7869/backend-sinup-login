For using this you should install all the dependencies which are :-
1. express
2. mongoose
3. body parser
To install the dependencies run "npm install express mongoose body-parser". 

I have kept it as simple as I could. This repo workes with mongodb node and simple hmtl forms. The html forms post data to the node.js run server and the server
handles the data flow and decides to give user authentication. All recordes are stored in the mongodb database that I have access to. All the pages and results of 
server are too simple and only html based just for simplicity.
